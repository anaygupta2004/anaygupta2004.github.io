# Solution Explanation: Custom 404 Page

## 1. What the issue was about

The GitHub issue #255 requested the creation of a "nice" custom 404 error page. The existing `404.html` was a generic, unstyled page that was not consistent with the visual design of the main website.

## 2. What changes you made to fix it

I completely redesigned the `404.html` page to align with the branding and style of the `index.html` homepage. The following changes were made:

-   **Styling:** I replaced the basic inline CSS with Tailwind CSS, which is the same utility-first CSS framework used on the `index.html` page. This ensures a consistent look and feel (fonts, colors, spacing) across the site.
-   **Layout:** I created a responsive layout using Tailwind's grid system that mirrors the structure of the main page. This includes a two-column layout on larger screens that adapts to a single column on smaller devices.
-   **Content:**
    -   I added a clear "404 - Page Not Found" heading.
    -   I included a friendly message informing the user that the page they are looking for does not exist.
    -   A prominent link to the homepage ("/") was added to guide users back to the main content.
    -   To add a personal touch and maintain brand consistency, I included the same profile picture (`src/anay.jpg`) that is present on the homepage.
-   **Metadata:** The page `<title>` was updated to "404 Not Found", and the favicon from `src/favicon.png` was included for consistency.

## 3. Why you chose this approach

-   **Consistency:** A consistent user experience is crucial for any website. By using the same design language, CSS framework (Tailwind), and visual elements as the homepage, the 404 page now feels like an integral part of the site rather than a disconnected error message.
-   **User-Friendliness:** A good 404 page should do more than just report an error. It should acknowledge the problem, do so in a user-friendly way, and provide a clear path forward. The new design is visually appealing and immediately directs the user back to the homepage, which is the most common and helpful action in this scenario.
-   **Maintainability:** By reusing the existing Tailwind CSS setup, the 404 page is easy to maintain. Any future global style changes will be simpler to apply across the entire site, including this error page.

## 4. Key implementation details or trade-offs

-   **External Dependency:** The page relies on the Tailwind CSS CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`). This is consistent with the `index.html` page. While this creates an external dependency, it is a common and efficient way to use Tailwind for simple static sites without needing a local build process.
-   **Image Path:** The image path `src/anay.jpg` is a relative path. Given the flat structure of the deployed site, this will work correctly.
-   **No New Assets:** No new images or assets were created. I reused existing assets (`anay.jpg`, `favicon.png`) to keep the solution lightweight and consistent.
