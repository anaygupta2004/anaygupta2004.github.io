+# Dark Mode Implementation Solution
+
+## Overview
+I successfully implemented a comprehensive dark mode feature for Anay Gupta's personal website with an aesthetic toggle button and smooth transitions. The implementation includes theme persistence, responsive design, and maintains the existing visual hierarchy while providing an excellent user experience.
+
+## Key Changes Made
+
+### 1. CSS Custom Properties System
+- **Added CSS variables** for both light and dark themes in the `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors
+- **Color scheme**: 
+  - Light mode: White background (#ffffff) with dark text (#1f2937)
+  - Dark mode: Dark slate background (#0f172a) with light text (#f1f5f9)
+  - Accent colors: Sky blue for light mode, light blue for dark mode
+- **Smooth transitions**: Added 0.3s ease transitions for background-color and color changes
+
+### 2. Aesthetic Toggle Button
+- **Fixed positioning**: Top-right corner (20px from top and right)
+- **Modern design**: Rounded button with subtle shadow and hover effects
+- **Icon system**: Sun icon for dark mode (to switch to light), moon icon for light mode (to switch to dark)
+- **Interactive feedback**: Scale animation on hover (1.05x) and enhanced shadow
+- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA label for screen readers
+
+### 3. JavaScript Functionality
+- **Theme persistence**: Uses localStorage to remember user preference across sessions
+- **Automatic initialization**: Checks saved theme on page load and applies it
+- **Icon management**: Dynamically shows/hides sun/moon icons based on current theme
+- **Event handling**: Clean click event listener for theme switching
+
+### 4. HTML Structure Updates
+- **Updated body classes**: Replaced Tailwind classes with custom dark-mode classes
+- **Link styling**: Converted all sky-600/sky-800 classes to use dark-mode-accent class
+- **Consistent theming**: Applied dark-mode classes throughout all sections
+
+## Technical Approach
+
+### Why CSS Custom Properties?
+I chose CSS custom properties (CSS variables) over Tailwind's dark mode classes because:
+- **Better performance**: Single CSS variable change affects all elements
+- **Smoother transitions**: Can animate CSS variables directly
+- **Easier maintenance**: Centralized color management
+- **More control**: Custom timing and easing for transitions
+
+### Design Decisions
+
+1. **Color Palette**: 
+   - Used a professional dark slate theme that's easy on the eyes
+   - Maintained sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
+   - Kept the blue accent color but adjusted brightness for dark mode
+
+2. **Toggle Placement**:
+   - Fixed position in top-right corner for easy access
+   - High z-index (1000) to ensure it's always visible
+   - Non-intrusive design that doesn't interfere with content
+
+3. **Icon Logic**:
+   - Shows moon icon in light mode (click to go dark)
+   - Shows sun icon in dark mode (click to go light)
+   - This follows common UI patterns users expect
+
+### Implementation Benefits
+
+1. **User Experience**:
+   - Instant theme switching with smooth animations
+   - Preference persistence across browser sessions
+   - Intuitive icon-based toggle
+
+2. **Performance**:
+   - Minimal JavaScript overhead
+   - CSS-only transitions for smooth animations
+   - Efficient localStorage usage
+
+3. **Maintainability**:
+   - Centralized color management through CSS variables
+   - Clean separation of concerns (CSS for styling, JS for functionality)
+   - Easy to extend with additional themes
+
+4. **Accessibility**:
+   - Proper ARIA labels
+   - Keyboard accessible toggle button
+   - Maintains color contrast ratios
+
+## Trade-offs Considered
+
+1. **CSS Variables vs Tailwind Dark Mode**: 
+   - Chose CSS variables for better transition control and centralized management
+   - Trade-off: Slightly more custom CSS vs leveraging Tailwind's built-in dark mode
+
+2. **Fixed vs Relative Positioning**:
+   - Chose fixed positioning for consistent access
+   - Trade-off: May overlap content on very small screens (mitigated with responsive design)
+
+3. **Icon Approach**:
+   - Used SVG icons for crisp rendering at all sizes
+   - Trade-off: Slightly larger HTML vs better visual quality
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+The implementation is designed to be easily extensible:
+- Additional themes can be added by creating new `[data-theme="theme-name"]` selectors
+- System preference detection could be added with `prefers-color-scheme`
+- Animation timing and easing can be easily adjusted through CSS variables
+- The toggle button design can be customized without affecting functionality
+
+This implementation provides a professional, accessible, and maintainable dark mode solution that enhances the user experience while preserving the website's existing design integrity.
