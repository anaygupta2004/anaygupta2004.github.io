## Setup Formspree

To make the contact form functional, you need to set up Formspree:

1. **Create a Formspree account**
   - Go to [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Create a new form**
   - After logging in, click "New Form"
   - Give your form a name (e.g., "Personal Website Contact")
   - Copy the form endpoint URL (it will look like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)

3. **Update the contact form**
   - Open `contact.html`
   - Find this line (around line 40):
     ```html
     <form id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST" class="space-y-6">
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID

4. **Configure Formspree settings** (optional but recommended)
   - In your Formspree dashboard, you can:
     - Set up email notifications
